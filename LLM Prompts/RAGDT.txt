You are an experienced product designer applying the Stanford Design Thinking process to develop a design concept for this product: Hair Dryer.
From some initial research, the following design insights were gathered and may be useful: 
[
{
"Requirement": "adaptability to different hair dryers",
"Design_features": [
"a nozzle attachment is designed to seat securely on the hair dryer opening",
"actuator driver circuit driven by user-selected oscillation mode",
"computer-aided control system for accurate positioning",
"heating element to vaporize the solution",
"securing portion: ensures the apparatus is firmly attached to the door, preventing it from falling or moving during use"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "adjustable airflow direction",
"Design_features": [
"a heat conductive element is positioned within the nozzle attachment near the slotted opening",
"channel wall intermediate the inlet end and the closed end of the discharge housing"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "hands-free operation",
"Design_features": [
"actuator driver circuit for automated nozzle control",
"base for stable positioning",
"power outlets",
"user interface for selecting oscillation modes",
"wireless internet connectivity"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "integrated control (potentially with other styling tools)",
"Design_features": [
"communication between the user interface and the actuator driver circuit",
"controller electrically connected to the fan, heater, and temperature sensor",
"controller receives control signals from the temperature sensor",
"user interface (optionally pertaining to a hair-styling tool)"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "reduced weight for user comfort",
"Design_features": [
"external power supply, removing the weight of the power components from the handheld housing"
]
}
].
**Think step-by-step through the following phases to develop your concept. 
After your thinking process, produce the final design concept in the specified JSON format.**
**Phase 1: Empathise (Understand the User)**
- Who are the primary users of this product, and what are their key pain points?
- Do some background research if necessary to collect users' needs.
- What aesthetic, emotional, technical, and social needs should this product address?

**Phase 2: Define (Frame the Problem and Identify Key Requirements)**
- Based on your Phase 1 findings, what are the problems this {design} should solve?
- To solve the problems, what are the design requirements the product needs to fulfil?
- What other design requirements does the product need to fulfil to make it more practical? 

**Phase 3: Ideate (Generate Ideas & Features)**
- For each requirement identified in Phase 2, brainstorm design features or solutions.
- Consider innovative technologies or approaches, e.g. inspiration from other industries or domains.
- Think about how these features will work and benefit the user.

**Phase 4: Prototype (Concept development)**
- Synthesise the ideas generated in Phase 3, and propose a comprehensive design concept. 
- Consider practicalities, e.g. materials, cost, and manufacturing.
- Consider the characteristics of the component used. 

**Final Output Format (Strict JSON):**
Your entire final response, after the thinking process, MUST be a single JSON object.
Each item in the list should be an object representing one of the key design requirements you defined.
Each object must have two keys:
1.  "Req": A string describing the key design requirement (from your 'Define' phase).
2.  "Design": A list of semantic triples [Subject, Predicate, Object] detailing the features and functionalities ideated for that requirement.
**Example JSON Structure:**
[
  {{
    "Req": "Ensure durability and reliability",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Case", "is_made_of", "Stainless steel" ]},
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "Req": "Compact and integrated design for easy storage",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Handle", "features", "Slim profile" ]}
      {[ "Product", "can_be_integrated_into", "Modular furniture units" ]},
    ]
  }}
  ...
