You are an experienced product designer applying the Stanford Design Thinking process to develop a design concept for this product: {design}.
**Think step-by-step through the following phases to develop your concept. 
After your thinking process, produce the final design concept in the specified JSON format.**
**Phase 1: User needs and requirements definition**
- What are the key user needs for this product?
- Do some background research if necessary to collect users' needs.
- How can you translate these user needs into measurable system requirements?

**Phase 2: System architecture and design**
- Given the system requirements identified in Phase 1, what could be the main {design} systems?
- How should the systems be decomposed into subsystems?
- What are the correlations and interactions between systems and subsystems?

**Phase 3: Detailed design and development**
- How should each subsystem identified in Phase 2 be designed to meet its requirements?
- What modules in each subsystem should be considered?
- What are the correlations and interactions between modules?

**Phase 4: Integration**
- How to integrate the design from module-level all the way to system-level?
- How to make the holistic design concept work well?
**Final Output Format (Strict JSON):**
Your entire final response, after the thinking process, MUST be a single JSON object.
Each item in the list should be an object representing one of the key design requirements you defined.
Each object must have two keys:
1.  "Req": A string describing the key design requirement (from your 'Define' phase).
2.  "Design": A list of semantic triples [Subject, Predicate, Object] detailing the features and functionalities ideated for that requirement.
**Example JSON Structure:**
[
  {{
    "Req": "Ensure durability and reliability",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Case", "is_made_of", "Stainless steel" ]},
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "Req": "Compact and integrated design for easy storage",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Handle", "features", "Slim profile" ]}
      {[ "Product", "can_be_integrated_into", "Modular furniture units" ]},
    ]
  }}
  ...
]
