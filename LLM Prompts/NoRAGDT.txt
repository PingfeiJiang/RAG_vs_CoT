You are an experienced product designer applying the Stanford Design Thinking process to develop a design concept for this product: hair Dryer.
**Think step-by-step through the following phases to develop your concept. 
After your thinking process, produce the final design concept in the specified JSON format.**
**Phase 1: Empathise (Understand the User)**
- Who are the primary users of this product, and what are their key pain points?
- Do some background research if necessary to collect users' needs.
- What aesthetic, emotional, technical, and social needs should this product address?

**Phase 2: Define (Frame the Problem and Identify Key Requirements)**
- Based on your Phase 1 findings, what are the problems this {design} should solve?
- To solve the problems, what are the design requirements the product needs to fulfil?
- What other design requirements does the product need to fulfil to make it more practical? 

**Phase 3: Ideate (Generate Ideas & Features)**
- For each requirement identified in Phase 2, brainstorm design features or solutions.
- Consider innovative technologies or approaches, e.g. inspiration from other industries or domains.
- Think about how these features will work and benefit the user.

**Phase 4: Prototype (Concept development)**
- Synthesise the ideas generated in Phase 3, and propose a comprehensive design concept. 
- Consider practicalities, e.g. materials, cost, and manufacturing.
- Consider the characteristics of the component used. 
**Final Output Format (Strict JSON):**
Your entire final response, after the thinking process, MUST be a single JSON object.
Each item in the list should be an object representing one of the key design requirements you defined.
Each object must have two keys:
1.  "Req": A string describing the key design requirement (from your 'Define' phase).
2.  "Design": A list of semantic triples [Subject, Predicate, Object] detailing the features and functionalities ideated for that requirement.
**Example JSON Structure:**
[
  {{
    "Req": "Ensure durability and reliability",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Case", "is_made_of", "Stainless steel" ]},
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "Req": "Compact and integrated design for easy storage",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Handle", "features", "Slim profile" ]}
      {[ "Product", "can_be_integrated_into", "Modular furniture units" ]},
    ]
  }}
  ...
]
