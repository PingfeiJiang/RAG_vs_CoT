You are an experienced product designer.
Generate a design concept for this product: {design}.
From some initial research, the following design insights were gathered and may be useful: 
[
{
"Requirement": "adaptability to different hair dryers",
"Design_features": [
"a nozzle attachment is designed to seat securely on the hair dryer opening",
"actuator driver circuit driven by user-selected oscillation mode",
"computer-aided control system for accurate positioning",
"heating element to vaporize the solution",
"securing portion: ensures the apparatus is firmly attached to the door, preventing it from falling or moving during use"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "adjustable airflow direction",
"Design_features": [
"a heat conductive element is positioned within the nozzle attachment near the slotted opening",
"channel wall intermediate the inlet end and the closed end of the discharge housing"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "hands-free operation",
"Design_features": [
"actuator driver circuit for automated nozzle control",
"base for stable positioning",
"power outlets",
"user interface for selecting oscillation modes",
"wireless internet connectivity"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "integrated control (potentially with other styling tools)",
"Design_features": [
"communication between the user interface and the actuator driver circuit",
"controller electrically connected to the fan, heater, and temperature sensor",
"controller receives control signals from the temperature sensor",
"user interface (optionally pertaining to a hair-styling tool)"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "reduced weight for user comfort",
"Design_features": [
"external power supply, removing the weight of the power components from the handheld housing"
]
}
]
Your response must be a single JSON list.
Each item in the list should be an object representing a distinct design requirement or design aspect.
Each object must have two keys:
1.  "Req": A string describing the design requirement or design aspect.
2.  "Design": A list of semantic triples describing how that aspect works. Each triple must be a list of three strings: [Subject, Predicate, Object].
**Example JSON Structure:**
[
  {{
    "Req": "Ensure durability and reliability",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Case", "is_made_of", "Stainless steel" ]},
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "Req": "Compact and integrated design for easy storage",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Handle", "features", "Slim profile" ]}
      {[ "Product", "can_be_integrated_into", "Modular furniture units" ]},
    ]
  }}
  ...
