You are an experienced product designer applying the Stanford Design Thinking process to develop a design concept for this product: Hair Dryer.
From some initial research, the following design insights were gathered and may be useful: 
[
{
"Requirement": "adaptability to different hair dryers",
"Design_features": [
"a nozzle attachment is designed to seat securely on the hair dryer opening",
"actuator driver circuit driven by user-selected oscillation mode",
"computer-aided control system for accurate positioning",
"heating element to vaporize the solution",
"securing portion: ensures the apparatus is firmly attached to the door, preventing it from falling or moving during use"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "adjustable airflow direction",
"Design_features": [
"a heat conductive element is positioned within the nozzle attachment near the slotted opening",
"channel wall intermediate the inlet end and the closed end of the discharge housing"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "hands-free operation",
"Design_features": [
"actuator driver circuit for automated nozzle control",
"base for stable positioning",
"power outlets",
"user interface for selecting oscillation modes",
"wireless internet connectivity"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "integrated control (potentially with other styling tools)",
"Design_features": [
"communication between the user interface and the actuator driver circuit",
"controller electrically connected to the fan, heater, and temperature sensor",
"controller receives control signals from the temperature sensor",
"user interface (optionally pertaining to a hair-styling tool)"
]
},
{
"Requirement": "reduced weight for user comfort",
"Design_features": [
"external power supply, removing the weight of the power components from the handheld housing"
]
}
].
**Think step-by-step through the following phases to develop your concept. 
After your thinking process, produce the final design concept in the specified JSON format.**
**Phase 1: User needs and requirements definition**
- What are the key user needs for this product?
- Do some background research if necessary to collect users' needs.
- How can you translate these user needs into measurable system requirements?

**Phase 2: System architecture and design**
- Given the system requirements identified in Phase 1, what could be the main {design} systems?
- How should the systems be decomposed into subsystems?
- What are the correlations and interactions between systems and subsystems?

**Phase 3: Detailed design and development**
- How should each subsystem identified in Phase 2 be designed to meet its requirements?
- What modules in each subsystem should be considered?
- What are the correlations and interactions between modules?

**Phase 4: Integration**
- How to integrate the design from module-level all the way to system-level?
- How to make the holistic design concept work well?
**Final Output Format (Strict JSON):**
Your entire final response, after the thinking process, MUST be a single JSON object.
Each item in the list should be an object representing one of the key design requirements you defined.
Each object must have two keys:
1.  "Req": A string describing the key design requirement (from your 'Define' phase).
2.  "Design": A list of semantic triples [Subject, Predicate, Object] detailing the features and functionalities ideated for that requirement.
**Example JSON Structure:**
[
  {{
    "Req": "Ensure durability and reliability",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Case", "is_made_of", "Stainless steel" ]},
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "Req": "Compact and integrated design for easy storage",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Handle", "features", "Slim profile" ]}
      {[ "Product", "can_be_integrated_into", "Modular furniture units" ]},
    ]
  }}
  ...
