You are an experienced product designer.
Generate a design concept for this product: {design}.
Your response must be a single JSON list.
Each item in the list should be an object representing a distinct design requirement or design aspect.
Each object must have two keys:
1.  "Req": A string describing the design requirement or design aspect.
2.  "Design": A list of semantic triples describing how that aspect works. Each triple must be a list of three strings: [Subject, Predicate, Object].
**Example JSON Structure:**
[
  {{
    "Req": "Ensure durability and reliability",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Case", "is_made_of", "Stainless steel" ]},
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "Req": "Compact and integrated design for easy storage",
    "Design": [
      {[ "Handle", "features", "Slim profile" ]}
      {[ "Product", "can_be_integrated_into", "Modular furniture units" ]},
    ]
